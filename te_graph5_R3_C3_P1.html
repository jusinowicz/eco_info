    <h1>Transfer entropy: 7 species, no noise</h1>
    <h2>Information transmission: Transfer entropy</h2>
    <p>This is the transfer entropy for 7 species: 3 Resource (RED), 3 Consumer (BLUE), and 1 Predator (BLACK) species. The arrows indicate the direction of information transfer, and the thickness of lines corresponds to the relative amount of information transferred.</p> 

	 <p>This is an interactive image. Zoom in and out by scrolling. Click to highlight the information transferred from a particular species and move nodes around. </p>
